Add unit testing with "catch" library. 
Possibly overload operators *, +, etc with gsl.
Add documentation.

More features:
	CISD
	DFT
	Obara-Saika for generating integrals
	Davidson diagonalization for larger CIS and/or RPA matrices
	Relative intensity for excited states

Optimizations:
	More "clever" ways to assign elements in gsl_matrix
	Tensor contractions
	CPU/GPU parallelization
