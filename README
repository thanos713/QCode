First version of QCode, an educational software for quantum chemistry calculations based on GSL (GNU Scientific Library). The code is not optimized, but it should work.
The reason I am coding this is for personal practice, but it would be great if someone could also benefit from it.

The idea is taken from prof. Crawford.

Currently supporting: HF + DIIS	
		      MP2
	              CCSD + DIIS
                      CCSD(T)
                      CIS
                      RPA
but by providing the one and two electron integrals. 

Documentation is not available yet, but you can see the example files to get an idea on how to run sample calculations. The example is for H2O with STO-3G.

NOTE: Remember to add the absolute path of GSL to the Makefile, before trying to compile.

Best,
Thanos Papas.
